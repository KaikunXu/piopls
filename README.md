# π-OPLS-DA (`piopls`)

> A high-performance, Pythonic implementation of Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), tailored for metabolomics and bioinformatics.

`piopls` bridges the gap between the rigorous algorithmic foundation of the gold-standard R package `ropls` and the modern Python data science ecosystem. It delivers blazing-fast parallel computing, native Pandas integration, and publication-ready visualizations—all in one lightweight package.

##  Core Capabilities

+ **Standardized Rigor:** Perfectly replicates `ropls` step-wise variance increments ($R^2X$, $R^2Y$, $Q^2$) and NIPALS-based orthogonal signal correction (OSC).
+ **Pandas Native:** Seamlessly feed `pandas.DataFrame` into the model. Sample IDs and feature names are automatically tracked, eliminating the need for tedious matrix index management.
+ **Multi-Core Acceleration:** Powered by `joblib`, permutation tests are fully parallelized, reducing computation time for 100+ permutations from minutes to mere seconds.
+ **Publication-Ready Graphics:** Built on `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to generate clean, high-resolution diagnostic plots with smart legend placement. 
+ **Structured Export:** Extract model parameters, sample scores, and biomarker statistics (VIP, Covariance, Correlation) as instantly usable DataFrames for downstream pipelines.

##  Installation

Install directly from GitHub using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KaikunXu/piopls.git
```

##  Quickstart & Tutorials
We provide interactive Jupyter Notebooks that walk you through the entire OPLS-DA workflow, from data loading and model fitting to permutation testing and publication-ready visualization.

Instead of static code snippets, please refer to our executable tutorials to get started immediately:

##  Generated Diagnostic Plots

Running the visualizer as demonstrated in the notebooks will automatically generate the following tightly integrated subplots:

+ Model Overview: Displays valid $R^2Y$ and $Q^2$ for the predictive ($p_1$) and orthogonal ($o_n$) components.
+ X-Score Plot: Visualizes sample clustering with 95% confidence ellipses.
+ Permutation Test: Validates model robustness against overfitting with empirical p-values.
+ S-Plot: Highlights biomarkers based on covariance and correlation.
+ VIP Bar Plot: Ranks top features contributing to the group separation.
